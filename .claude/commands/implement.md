# Implement - Execute Implementation Plan

Execute an implementation plan that has been created.

## Variables

- `$ARGUMENTS`: The implementation plan content

## Instructions

1. **Read the plan carefully**
   - Understand all phases and tasks
   - Note the order of operations
   - Identify validation commands

2. **Think hard about the approach**
   - Consider edge cases
   - Think about error handling
   - Plan for testability

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Follow the step-by-step tasks in order
   - Implement each phase completely
   - Test as you go

4. **Verify implementation**
   - Run validation commands from the plan
   - Check that tests pass
   - Verify builds succeed

## Quality Guidelines

- **Follow the plan** - Don't deviate without good reason
- **Write clean code** - Follow project conventions
- **Handle errors** - Add appropriate error handling
- **Test thoroughly** - Ensure nothing breaks
- **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer

## Report
